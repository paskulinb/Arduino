/* DS1820 temperature sensor block
 * The conversion process of DS1820 sensor takes at least 750ms by the specefifcations.
 * This block divides the DS1820 sensor useage into two step:
 * 1. Conversion issue by startConversion() method
 * 2. Reading conversion result from sensor by readTemperatrue() method
 * The result is stored in 'temperature' property of this class. The user
 * can get this value by get() method.
 * 
 * 1. Undependent usage of this block:
 * 
 * startConversion();
 * delay(800);
 * if (dataReady() == DS1820_STAT_DATA_READY) {
 *     get(0, &temp);
 * }
 * 
 * Also possible:
 * 
 * startConversion();
 * while(dataReady() != DS1820_STAT_DATA_READY) {sleep(200);}
 * get(0, &temp);
 * 
 * 2. Block connection usage:
 * The conversion is started through calling trigger() method.
 * If trigger_caller_block pointer is passed to the method,
 * the *trigger_caller_block will be called after conversion completed.
 * In order to automatically read sensor and trigger the trigger_caller_block after conversion finished,
 * this block has to be 'connected' to BlockTimer using setTimer() method.
 * 
 * BlockTiming TIMING;  //in global scope
 *
 * //In your SETUP procedure:
 * BlockBase* DS1820 = new BSensorDS1820(12, TIMING);  //DS1820 will create his own Timer using BlockTiming functionality
 * 
 * //In the infinite LOOP must be:
 * TIMING.update();

/** Temperature sensor DS1820.
 * This class provides temperatue measurement from DS1820. It does not block microcontroller's code execution while DS1820 conversion is in progress.
 * After successfull reading, the value is available in \c output[0].
 * The measurement cycle is divided to two phases: \b conversion and \b reading from sensor.
 * After conversion issue the sensor needs at least 750 milliseconds to finish.
 * Then the result can be read.\n
 * BSensorDS1820 can be used in two modes; \b singleshot or \b periodic.\n
 * In \b singleshot mode \c (repeat_seconds = 0) every temperature measurement is started by \c trigger() method.\n
 * If \c repeat_seconds is greater than 0, BSensorDS1820 starts in \b periodic mode.\n
 * After every successfull tempreature conversion and reading, the value is stored to \c output[0]
 * and \c B_EVT_TEMPERATURE event is signaled.
 * If \c job_follow is set, BSensorDS1820 will call \c BlockSpider(job_follow) to trigger following Block.
